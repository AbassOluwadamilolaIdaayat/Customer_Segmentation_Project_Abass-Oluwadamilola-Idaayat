A project on Customer Segmentation In Power BI
This report presents the development and insights of a Power BI dashboard for customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on the marketing_campaign.xlsx dataset. The dashboard visualizes customer demographics, spending behavior, product preferences, campaign responses, and channel preferences, focusing on Age Groups (Under 30, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+).
Key performance indicators (KPIs) include total customers, average age, income, recency, and RFM segment distribution
The objective was to create a Power BI dashboard that:
Segments customers into three RFM groups: Champions, Potential, and At Risk.
Visualizes KPIs: total customers, average age, income, recency, and segment distribution.
Highlights Age Groups versus:
Total Spend: Sum of spending across product categories.
Predominant Products: Most purchased product per Age Group
Campaign Preferences: Total campaign acceptances.
Channel Preferences: Purchase counts by channel (Web, Catalog, Store)

Recommendations
* Champions (High-Value): Offer loyalty programs or premium products (e.g., exclusive wines) to retain 60+ customers with high spends.
* Potential (Mid-Value): Target with personalized campaigns (e.g., discounts on Meat/Wines) to increase frequency and spend, especially for 30-49 groups.
* At Risk (Low-Value): Re-engage with discounts or promotions (e.g., free shipping for Web purchases) for younger groups (Under 30).
* Product Strategy: Focus on Wines and Meat for older groups; promote Fruits/Sweets for younger customers.*Channel Strategy: Enhance Catalog marketing for 60+; optimize Web platform for Under 30.

Conclusion
The Customer Segmentation Dashboard effectively segments customers using RFM analysis, providing clear visualizations of Age Group trends in spending, product preferences, campaign responses, and channel usage. The sorted Age_Group (Under 30 to 60+) enhances readability, and the two-axis Combo Chart highlights correlations between spend and campaign engagement.  The insights enable targeted marketing strategies to maximize customer retention, revenue and reduce Customer Churn Rate.
These recommendations enable stakeholders to leverage the Customer Segmentation Dashboard for targeted marketing, optimized channels, and improved data quality. By focusing on Champions’ loyalty, Potential’s conversion, and At-Risk’s re-engagement, while tailoring products and channels by Age Group, the business can drive significant revenue growth and customer satisfaction. Regular dashboard monitoring and data validation will ensure sustained success.
